# Schedule-One-Hack

This is a experimental cheat for the game Schedule One.

Schedule One is built in Unity and has the IL2CPP backend so I used the <a href="https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper">IL2CPP Dumper</a> to dump offsets for function signatures which you will see in my hooks.

The cheat also features my <a href="https://github.com/llock1/ImGui-List-Menu">ImGui List Menu</a> (which needs some work).
